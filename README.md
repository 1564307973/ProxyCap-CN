## 📚 About ProxyCap

ProxyCap enables you to redirect your computer's network connections through proxy servers. You can tell ProxyCap which applications will connect to the Internet through a proxy and under what circumstances.

✨ **This is done through a user-friendly interface, without the need to reconfigure any of your Internet clients.** ProxyCap has native support for the SSH protocol, allowing you to specify a SSH server as the proxy server.
